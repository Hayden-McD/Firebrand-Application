            A few months ago I saw Firebrand advertising for three internship roles, but I was sad to see that none of those roles aligned with my study and plans for future work.
            One night I was sitting in bed scrolling through Instagram and I saw the advertisement for a developer role at Firebrand
            and a smile came to my face knowing that it was now a possibility for me to become a Firebrander.

            It would be an amazing oppertunity to work for Firebrand as I have always admired the positive culture and have been following the company on social media for many years,
            and would love to join your awesome team.
