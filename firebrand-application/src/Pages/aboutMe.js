            Over the years I have had many interests from Air Cadets to playing with all things electronic. I have gained a particular interest in crypto mining, 3d-printing,
            Gaming, Mountain biking and cars to name a few.

            I always like to keep myself busy by working on small projects or expanding my knowledge.
            I chose to study I.T as I felt this aligned with my areas of interest.
