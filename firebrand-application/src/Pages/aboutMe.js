          <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
          <h4>
            I am 21 years old, Dunedin born and raised. I still live at home with my amazing mum, my Dog Jazz and my Bearded Dragon Larry.
            Over the years I have had many interests from Air Cadets to playing with all things electronic. I have gained a particular interest in crypto mining, 3d-printing,
            Gaming, Mountain biking and cars to name a few. I always like to keep myself busy by working on small projects or expanding my knowledge.
            I chose to study I.T as I felt this aligned with my areas of interest.
